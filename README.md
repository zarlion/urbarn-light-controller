# 🚀 URBARN Light Controller

**Custom Android app for controlling URBARN Bluetooth mesh lights using reverse-engineered credentials.**

## ✨ Features

- 🔍 **Scan** for nearby URBARN mesh devices
- 🔗 **Connect** and authenticate automatically using discovered credentials
- 💡 **Control** lights individually (ON/OFF functionality)
- 📱 **Mobile-optimized** touch interface built with Kivy
- 🔐 **No official app required** - uses reverse-engineered mesh credentials!

## 🔐 Discovered Credentials

Through reverse engineering of the official URBARN app, we discovered:
- **Primary Mesh:** `URBARN` / `15102` 
- **Secondary Mesh:** `Fulife` / `2846`
